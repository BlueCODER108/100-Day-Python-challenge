# Let's get coding!
Let's start with some simple code to get a simple output (the information the program gives to the user).


ðŸ‘‰ Type this line of code in `main.py` and click `run`. 



```python
print("Hello Replit")
```

(HINT: Anytime you see ðŸ‘‰ this means you are going to copy, add or write code in the coding editor).

If everything works as expected your console should now show you your lovely message!
